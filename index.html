            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the <b>Salifort Motors Project Showcase</b>! My name is <b>Tobin Zolkowski</b>, and this project is a deep dive into understanding what makes employees stay or leave a company. Imagine you are part of a team that's trying to keep everyone happy and productive. This project helps us figure out how to do that using data.</p>
            <p>This project includes <b>exploratory data analysis (EDA)</b>, <b>feature engineering</b>, and <b>predictive modeling</b> to identify key factors influencing employee retention and turnover. The project is structured into several stages following the <u>PACE framework</u>: <b>Plan, Analyze, Construct, and Execute</b>.</p>
            <h3>Understanding the Business Scenario and Problem</h3>
            <p>Salifort Motors is facing a significant challenge with <span class="highlight">high employee turnover rates</span>. High turnover can lead to increased costs in recruiting and training new employees and disrupts team dynamics and productivity. The HR department sought a <b>data-driven approach</b> to identify key factors that influence employees' decisions to leave, with the goal of improving retention strategies and enhancing overall employee satisfaction.</p>

            <h2>Data Exploration and Visualization</h2>
            <p>Our journey starts with exploring the data. Think of it like getting to know the team better by looking at different aspects of their work life.</p>
            <h3>Data Preparation</h3>
            <button class="collapsible" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="data-prep-content">Data Preparation Details</button>
            <div class="content" id="data-prep-content">
                <p>The data preparation stage involved <b>cleaning the dataset</b> and <b>encoding categorical variables</b> using <u>one-hot encoding</u>. This process ensures that our data is ready for analysis and modeling. Categorical variables like 'Department' and 'salary' were transformed into numerical values that models can understand.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Data Introduction</h3>
            <p>The dataset provided by the HR department contains <span class="highlight">15,000 rows</span> and <span class="highlight">10 columns</span>, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>satisfaction_level</b>: Employee-reported job satisfaction level (0–1)</li>
                <li><b>last_evaluation</b>: Score of employee’s last performance review (0–1)</li>
                <li><b>number_project</b>: Number of projects employee contributes to</li>
                <li><b>average_monthly_hours</b>: Average number of hours worked per month</li>
                <li><b>time_spend_company</b>: Years spent at the company</li>
                <li><b>Work_accident</b>: Whether the employee experienced a work accident</li>
                <li><b>left</b>: Whether the employee left the company</li>
                <li><b>promotion_last_5years</b>: Whether the employee was promoted in the last 5 years</li>
                <li><b>Department</b>: Employee’s department</li>
                <li><b>salary</b>: Employee’s salary (low, medium, high)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Cleaning</h3>
            <p>The first step was to understand the dataset by performing <b>EDA</b>. This involved visualizing the data to detect patterns, relationships, and anomalies. We also cleaned the data to handle any missing values and outliers.</p>
            <h4>Descriptive Statistics</h4>
            <p>Here are some key statistics about the dataset:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Average satisfaction level: <span class="highlight">0.629</span></li>
                <li>Average last evaluation score: <span class="highlight">0.717</span></li>
                <li>Average number of projects: <span class="highlight">3.8</span></li>
                <li>Average monthly hours: <span class="highlight">200</span></li>
                <li>Median tenure: <span class="highlight">3 years</span></li>
                <li>Percentage of employees who left: <span class="highlight">16.6%</span></li>
                <li>Percentage of employees who had work accidents: <span class="highlight">15.4%</span></li>
                <li>Percentage of employees who were promoted in the last 5 years: <span class="highlight">1.7%</span></li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Reflections on Data Exploration</h4>
            <p>During the initial exploration, several interesting patterns emerged. For example, <b>employees with lower satisfaction levels</b> and those who were <b>not promoted in the last 5 years</b> showed higher turnover rates. Anomalies, such as very high or low average monthly hours, were also examined to understand their impact on turnover.</p>

            <h3>PACE Framework</h3>
            <button class="collapsible" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="plan-stage-content">Plan Stage</button>
            <div class="content" id="plan-stage-content">
                <p>The <b>Plan stage</b> involved understanding the business scenario and problem. The HR department at Salifort Motors wanted to improve employee satisfaction levels and reduce turnover. They asked for data-driven suggestions to identify factors influencing employees' decisions to leave.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="analyze-stage-content">Analyze Stage</button>
            <div class="content" id="analyze-stage-content">
                <p>In the <b>Analyze stage</b>, I conducted an in-depth <b>exploratory data analysis (EDA)</b>. This involved visualizing relationships between variables, detecting patterns, and identifying key factors influencing employee retention. For example, by looking at the correlation heatmap, we saw that <b>satisfaction levels</b> had a significant impact on whether employees stayed or left.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="construct-stage-content">Construct Stage</button>
            <div class="content" id="construct-stage-content">
                <p>During the <b>Construct stage</b>, I built predictive models to forecast employee turnover. Several models were considered, including <b>Logistic Regression</b>, <b>Random Forest</b>, and <b>XGBoost</b>. Logistic Regression is a simple model that helps us understand the impact of each feature on the outcome. Random Forest and XGBoost are more complex models that can capture intricate patterns in the data. These models were chosen for their balance between interpretability and predictive power.</p>
                <p><b>Logistic Regression:</b> This model is like a more advanced version of linear regression but used for classification. It's great for understanding the influence of different features but might not capture complex patterns.</p>
                <p><b>Random Forest:</b> Imagine a forest with many trees, where each tree makes a prediction. The forest combines these predictions for a more accurate result. It helps capture complex relationships in the data.</p>
                <p><b>XGBoost:</b> This is a powerful model that improves on the predictions of previous models by learning from their mistakes. It’s like a very diligent student who learns quickly from every error.</p>

            <h3>Hyperparameter Tuning</h3>
            <button class="collapsible" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="hyperparameter-content">Hyperparameter Tuning Details</button>
            <div class="content" id="hyperparameter-content">
                <p>We applied <u>GridSearchCV</u> to fine-tune the Random Forest model. Hyperparameters are settings that can be adjusted to optimize the model's performance. GridSearchCV tests different combinations of these settings to find the best configuration. After tuning, the Random Forest model's performance improved, showing better accuracy and recall.</p>

            <div class="content" id="feature-importance-content">
                <p>Identifying the most important features helps us understand what factors contribute most to employee churn. Both the Random Forest and XGBoost models indicated that satisfaction level, number of projects, and last evaluation scores were the most influential features.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Cross-Validation</h3>
            <button class="collapsible" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="cross-validation-content">Cross-Validation Details</button>
            <div class="content" id="cross-validation-content">
                <p>To ensure our model's performance is reliable, we employed <u>k-fold cross-validation</u>. This technique splits the data into k subsets and trains the model k times, each time using a different subset as the test set. This helps in obtaining a more accurate estimate of the model's performance.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Underfitting and Overfitting</h3>
            <p>In predictive modeling, it's crucial to strike a balance between <span class="highlight">underfitting</span> and <span class="highlight">overfitting</span>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Underfitting</b> occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. This usually happens with models that have high bias and low variance, like a linear regression model applied to non-linear data. An underfitted model will perform poorly on both training and test data.</li>
                <li><b>Overfitting</b> happens when a model is too complex and captures noise or random fluctuations in the training data. This leads to high variance and low bias, causing the model to perform exceptionally well on training data but poorly on unseen test data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To determine if a model is underfitting or overfitting, we can look at the performance metrics on both training and validation datasets:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If a model has <b>low accuracy</b> on both training and validation data, it is likely <b>underfitting</b>.</li>
                <li>If a model has <b>high accuracy</b> on training data but significantly <b>lower accuracy</b> on validation data, it is likely <b>overfitting</b>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In this project, we used techniques like <u>cross-validation</u> and <u>hyperparameter tuning</u> to mitigate underfitting and overfitting:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Cross-validation:</b> By using k-fold cross-validation, we ensured our model's performance is consistent across different subsets of data, which helps in identifying overfitting.</li>
                <li><b>Hyperparameter tuning:</b> We used GridSearchCV to find the optimal hyperparameters for the Random Forest model, which helps in balancing the model complexity to avoid both underfitting and overfitting.</li>
            </ul>

            </div>
            <p>We also look at the impact of work accidents on employee turnover. Safety is crucial for job satisfaction and retention. Most employees have not experienced work accidents. A smaller proportion of those who experienced work accidents (<span class="highlight">14%</span>) have left the company compared to those who haven't (<span class="highlight">23%</span>).</p>

            </div>
            <p>Using a Random Forest model, we identify the top factors that predict employee turnover. <b>Satisfaction, tenure, and projects</b> are key indicators. This tells us that how satisfied employees are, how long they've been with us, and how many projects they handle are crucial in understanding why they might leave. For instance, satisfaction level has a feature importance score of <span class="highlight">0.34</span>, making it the most significant factor.</p>

            <p>The XGBoost model provides similar insights, highlighting the importance of <b>projects</b> and <b>satisfaction</b>. This reinforces our understanding of the factors influencing employee turnover. Satisfaction level also has the highest importance in the XGBoost model, followed by number of projects and last evaluation scores.</p>

            <p>The ROC curve shows us how well our models can predict employee turnover. Both models perform exceptionally well, with high accuracy, indicating their reliability in predicting which employees might leave. The ROC AUC (Area Under the Curve) for both models is approximately <span class="highlight">0.98</span>, indicating strong predictive power.</p>

            <h3>Model Comparison and Best Model Selection</h3>
            <p>Among the three models, <b>XGBoost</b> showed the highest accuracy (<span class="highlight">97.96%</span>) and F1-Score (<span class="highlight">94%</span>). This model balances precision and recall well, making it the best choice for predicting employee churn. While Random Forest also performed well, XGBoost's slight edge in predictive power and its ability to learn from previous errors makes it the most suitable model for this task.</p>
