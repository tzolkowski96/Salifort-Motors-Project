            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the <b>Salifort Motors Project Showcase</b>! My name is <b>Tobin Zolkowski</b>, and this project is a deep dive into understanding what makes employees stay or leave a company. Imagine you are part of a team that's trying to keep everyone happy and productive. This project helps us figure out how to do that using data.</p>
            <p>This project includes <b>exploratory data analysis (EDA)</b>, <b>feature engineering</b>, and <b>predictive modeling</b> to identify key factors influencing employee retention and turnover. The project is structured into several stages following the <u>PACE framework</u>: <b>Plan, Analyze, Construct, and Execute</b>.</p>
            <h3>Understanding the Business Scenario and Problem</h3>
            <p>Salifort Motors is facing a significant challenge with <span class="highlight">high employee turnover rates</span>. High turnover can lead to increased costs in recruiting and training new employees and disrupts team dynamics and productivity. The HR department sought a <b>data-driven approach</b> to identify key factors that influence employees' decisions to leave, with the goal of improving retention strategies and enhancing overall employee satisfaction.</p>

            <h2>Data Exploration and Visualization</h2>
            <p>Our journey starts with exploring the data. Think of it like getting to know the team better by looking at different aspects of their work life.</p>
            <h3>Data Preparation</h3>
            <button class="collapsible">Data Preparation Details</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>The data preparation stage involved <b>cleaning the dataset</b> and <b>encoding categorical variables</b> using <u>one-hot encoding</u>. This process ensures that our data is ready for analysis and modeling. Categorical variables like 'Department' and 'salary' were transformed into numerical values that models can understand.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Data Introduction</h3>
            <p>The dataset provided by the HR department contains <span class="highlight">15,000 rows</span> and <span class="highlight">10 columns</span>, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>satisfaction_level</b>: Employee-reported job satisfaction level (0â€“1)</li>
                <li><b>last_evaluation</b>: Score of employeeâ€™s last performance review (0â€“1)</li>
                <li><b>number_project</b>: Number of projects employee contributes to</li>
                <li><b>average_monthly_hours</b>: Average number of hours worked per month</li>
                <li><b>time_spend_company</b>: Years spent at the company</li>
                <li><b>Work_accident</b>: Whether the employee experienced a work accident</li>
                <li><b>left</b>: Whether the employee left the company</li>
                <li><b>promotion_last_5years</b>: Whether the employee was promoted in the last 5 years</li>
                <li><b>Department</b>: Employeeâ€™s department</li>
                <li><b>salary</b>: Employeeâ€™s salary (low, medium, high)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Cleaning</h3>
            <p>The first step was to understand the dataset by performing <b>EDA</b>. This involved visualizing the data to detect patterns, relationships, and anomalies. We also cleaned the data to handle any missing values and outliers.</p>
            <h4>Descriptive Statistics</h4>
            <p>Here are some key statistics about the dataset:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Average satisfaction level: <span class="highlight">0.629</span></li>
                <li>Average last evaluation score: <span class="highlight">0.717</span></li>
                <li>Average number of projects: <span class="highlight">3.8</span></li>
                <li>Average monthly hours: <span class="highlight">200</span></li>
                <li>Median tenure: <span class="highlight">3 years</span></li>
                <li>Percentage of employees who left: <span class="highlight">16.6%</span></li>
                <li>Percentage of employees who had work accidents: <span class="highlight">15.4%</span></li>
                <li>Percentage of employees who were promoted in the last 5 years: <span class="highlight">1.7%</span></li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Reflections on Data Exploration</h4>
            <p>During the initial exploration, several interesting patterns emerged. For example, <b>employees with lower satisfaction levels</b> and those who were <b>not promoted in the last 5 years</b> showed higher turnover rates. Anomalies, such as very high or low average monthly hours, were also examined to understand their impact on turnover.</p>
            <div class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="image_1.png" alt="Boxplot of Tenure">
                <div class="caption">Boxplot of Tenure</div>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Shows the distribution of employee tenure.</span>
            </div>
            <p>This boxplot shows us how long employees have been with the company. Most have been here between <span class="highlight">3 to 4 years</span>, but there are some who have been with us much longer. The median tenure is around <span class="highlight">3 years</span>, indicating a relatively young workforce.</p>
            
            <div class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="image_2.png" alt="Correlation Heatmap">
                <div class="caption">Correlation Heatmap</div>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Displays correlation between various factors.</span>
            </div>
            <p>This heatmap reveals how different factors like <b>satisfaction</b>, <b>evaluation</b>, and <b>workload</b> relate to each other. For example, we see that satisfaction has a moderate negative correlation (<span class="highlight">-0.35</span>) with employees leaving the company, indicating that less satisfied employees are more likely to leave. This insight directs us to focus on improving satisfaction to retain employees.</p>
            
            <div class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="image_3.png" alt="Employees Leaving by Department">

                <span class="tooltiptext">Shows the distribution of employees leaving by department.</span>
            </div>
            <p>Here we see which departments have higher turnover rates. For instance, the <b>sales</b> and <b>technical</b> departments have the highest number of employees who left. Specifically, <span class="highlight">30%</span> of employees from the sales department and <span class="highlight">25%</span> from the technical department have left the company. This helps us know where to focus our efforts to improve retention.</p>

                <span class="tooltiptext">Illustrates the distribution of employees leaving by salary level.</span>
            </div>
            <p>Salary is a big factor in job satisfaction. This chart shows us how many people leave based on their salary level. We notice that employees with <b>lower salaries</b> have the highest number of departures (<span class="highlight">41%</span>), indicating the need to review and possibly adjust our compensation strategies. In contrast, only <span class="highlight">7%</span> of employees with high salaries have left.</p>

                <span class="tooltiptext">Displays the distribution of employee satisfaction levels.</span>
            </div>
            <p>Understanding satisfaction levels helps us know how happy our team is. This distribution shows us that we have both very satisfied and less satisfied employees, which can guide us in tailoring specific strategies to improve overall satisfaction. The average satisfaction level is <span class="highlight">0.629</span>, with a notable portion of employees having satisfaction levels below <span class="highlight">0.5</span>.</p>

                <span class="tooltiptext">Shows the distribution of employee last evaluation scores.</span>
            </div>
            <p>Performance evaluations tell us how employees are doing at their jobs. This chart shows the spread of these evaluations, helping us identify any patterns or anomalies in performance reviews that could impact employee retention. Most employees have evaluation scores between <span class="highlight">0.55</span> and <span class="highlight">0.75</span>, with a mean score of <span class="highlight">0.717</span>.</p>

            <h2>Further Analysis and Insights</h2>
            <p>After exploring the data, we dig deeper to uncover more insights.</p>
            <h3>PACE Framework</h3>
            <button class="collapsible">Plan Stage</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>The <b>Plan stage</b> involved understanding the business scenario and problem. The HR department at Salifort Motors wanted to improve employee satisfaction levels and reduce turnover. They asked for data-driven suggestions to identify factors influencing employees' decisions to leave.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible">Analyze Stage</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>In the <b>Analyze stage</b>, I conducted an in-depth <b>exploratory data analysis (EDA)</b>. This involved visualizing relationships between variables, detecting patterns, and identifying key factors influencing employee retention. For example, by looking at the correlation heatmap, we saw that <b>satisfaction levels</b> had a significant impact on whether employees stayed or left.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible">Construct Stage</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>During the <b>Construct stage</b>, I built predictive models to forecast employee turnover. Several models were considered, including <b>Logistic Regression</b>, <b>Random Forest</b>, and <b>XGBoost</b>. Logistic Regression is a simple model that helps us understand the impact of each feature on the outcome. Random Forest and XGBoost are more complex models that can capture intricate patterns in the data. These models were chosen for their balance between interpretability and predictive power.</p>
                <p><b>Logistic Regression:</b> This model is like a more advanced version of linear regression but used for classification. It's great for understanding the influence of different features but might not capture complex patterns.</p>
                <p><b>Random Forest:</b> Imagine a forest with many trees, where each tree makes a prediction. The forest combines these predictions for a more accurate result. It helps capture complex relationships in the data.</p>
                <p><b>XGBoost:</b> This is a powerful model that improves on the predictions of previous models by learning from their mistakes. Itâ€™s like a very diligent student who learns quickly from every error.</p>
            </div>
            <button class="collapsible">Execute Stage</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>In the <b>Execute stage</b>, I interpreted the model results and made actionable recommendations. The Random Forest and XGBoost models showed high accuracy, identifying key factors like satisfaction, tenure, and number of projects as significant predictors of employee turnover. These insights were then translated into specific actions to help retain employees.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Model Evaluation</h3>
            <div class="callout">
                <p><b>Accuracy:</b> The proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made.</p>
                <p><b>Precision:</b> The proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made. This tells us how many of the predicted leavers actually left.</p>
                <p><b>Recall:</b> The proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives. This tells us how many of the actual leavers were correctly identified.</p>
                <p><b>F1-Score:</b> The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Here are the evaluation metrics for each model:</p>
            <h4>Logistic Regression</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Accuracy: <span class="highlight">83.28%</span></li>
                <li>Precision: <span class="highlight">50%</span></li>
                <li>Recall: <span class="highlight">17%</span></li>
                <li>F1-Score: <span class="highlight">26%</span></li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Random Forest</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Accuracy: <span class="highlight">97.83%</span></li>
                <li>Precision: <span class="highlight">98%</span></li>
                <li>Recall: <span class="highlight">89%</span></li>
                <li>F1-Score: <span class="highlight">93%</span></li>
            </ul>
            <h4>XGBoost</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Accuracy: <span class="highlight">97.96%</span></li>
                <li>Precision: <span class="highlight">98%</span></li>

                <li>F1-Score: <span class="highlight">94%</span></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Hyperparameter Tuning</h3>
            <button class="collapsible">Hyperparameter Tuning Details</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>We applied <u>GridSearchCV</u> to fine-tune the Random Forest model. Hyperparameters are settings that can be adjusted to optimize the model's performance. GridSearchCV tests different combinations of these settings to find the best configuration. After tuning, the Random Forest model's performance improved, showing better accuracy and recall.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Feature Importance Analysis</h3>
            <button class="collapsible">Feature Importance Analysis Details</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Identifying the most important features helps us understand what factors contribute most to employee churn. Both the Random Forest and XGBoost models indicated that satisfaction level, number of projects, and last evaluation scores were the most influential features.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Cross-Validation</h3>
            <button class="collapsible">Cross-Validation Details</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>To ensure our model's performance is reliable, we employed <u>k-fold cross-validation</u>. This technique splits the data into k subsets and trains the model k times, each time using a different subset as the test set. This helps in obtaining a more accurate estimate of the model's performance.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Underfitting and Overfitting</h3>
            <p>In predictive modeling, it's crucial to strike a balance between <span class="highlight">underfitting</span> and <span class="highlight">overfitting</span>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Underfitting</b> occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. This usually happens with models that have high bias and low variance, like a linear regression model applied to non-linear data. An underfitted model will perform poorly on both training and test data.</li>
                <li><b>Overfitting</b> happens when a model is too complex and captures noise or random fluctuations in the training data. This leads to high variance and low bias, causing the model to perform exceptionally well on training data but poorly on unseen test data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To determine if a model is underfitting or overfitting, we can look at the performance metrics on both training and validation datasets:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If a model has <b>low accuracy</b> on both training and validation data, it is likely <b>underfitting</b>.</li>
                <li>If a model has <b>high accuracy</b> on training data but significantly <b>lower accuracy</b> on validation data, it is likely <b>overfitting</b>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In this project, we used techniques like <u>cross-validation</u> and <u>hyperparameter tuning</u> to mitigate underfitting and overfitting:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Cross-validation:</b> By using k-fold cross-validation, we ensured our model's performance is consistent across different subsets of data, which helps in identifying overfitting.</li>
                <li><b>Hyperparameter tuning:</b> We used GridSearchCV to find the optimal hyperparameters for the Random Forest model, which helps in balancing the model complexity to avoid both underfitting and overfitting.</li>
            </ul>

            </div>
            <p>We also look at the impact of work accidents on employee turnover. Safety is crucial for job satisfaction and retention. Most employees have not experienced work accidents. A smaller proportion of those who experienced work accidents (<span class="highlight">14%</span>) have left the company compared to those who haven't (<span class="highlight">23%</span>).</p>

            </div>
            <p>Using a Random Forest model, we identify the top factors that predict employee turnover. <b>Satisfaction, tenure, and projects</b> are key indicators. This tells us that how satisfied employees are, how long they've been with us, and how many projects they handle are crucial in understanding why they might leave. For instance, satisfaction level has a feature importance score of <span class="highlight">0.34</span>, making it the most significant factor.</p>
            
            <div class="image-container tooltip">

            </div>
            <p>The XGBoost model provides similar insights, highlighting the importance of <b>projects</b> and <b>satisfaction</b>. This reinforces our understanding of the factors influencing employee turnover. Satisfaction level also has the highest importance in the XGBoost model, followed by number of projects and last evaluation scores.</p>
            
            <div class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="image_15.png" alt="ROC Curve">
                <div class="caption">ROC Curve</div>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Shows the ROC curve for Random Forest and XGBoost models.</span>
            </div>
            <p>The ROC curve shows us how well our models can predict employee turnover. Both models perform exceptionally well, with high accuracy, indicating their reliability in predicting which employees might leave. The ROC AUC (Area Under the Curve) for both models is approximately <span class="highlight">0.98</span>, indicating strong predictive power.</p>

            <h3>Model Comparison and Best Model Selection</h3>
            <p>Among the three models, <b>XGBoost</b> showed the highest accuracy (<span class="highlight">97.96%</span>) and F1-Score (<span class="highlight">94%</span>). This model balances precision and recall well, making it the best choice for predicting employee churn. While Random Forest also performed well, XGBoost's slight edge in predictive power and its ability to learn from previous errors makes it the most suitable model for this task.</p>
