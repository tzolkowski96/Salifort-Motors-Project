            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the <b>Salifort Motors Project Showcase</b>! My name is <b>Tobin Zolkowski</b>. This project dives deep into the human side of data, exploring what makes employees thrive and what leads them to leave Salifort Motors. Think of it as a data detective story aimed at improving workplace happiness and productivity.</p>
            <p>Using <b>exploratory data analysis (EDA)</b>, clever <b>feature engineering</b>, and powerful <b>predictive modeling</b>, we'll uncover the key factors driving employee retention and turnover. Our journey follows the <u>PACE framework</u>: <b>Plan, Analyze, Construct, and Execute</b>, ensuring a structured and insightful approach.</p>
            <h3>The Challenge: Understanding Employee Turnover</h3>
            <p>Salifort Motors faced a common but costly challenge: <span class="highlight">higher-than-desired employee turnover</span>. Losing employees means more than just recruitment costs; it impacts team morale, knowledge continuity, and overall productivity. The HR team needed a <b>data-driven strategy</b> to understand the 'why' behind departures and build a more retentive workplace.</p>

            <h2>Phase 1: Exploring the Landscape (EDA)</h2>
            <p>Our journey begins by getting to know the Salifort team through data. We examined a dataset covering <span class="highlight">15,000 employees</span> across <span class="highlight">10 key attributes</span>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>satisfaction_level</b>: How happy are they? (0–1 scale)</li>
                <li><b>last_evaluation</b>: Performance review score (0–1 scale)</li>
                <li><b>number_project</b>: How many projects are they juggling?</li>
                <li><b>average_monthly_hours</b>: Workload intensity</li>
                <li><b>time_spend_company</b>: Years with Salifort</li>
                <li><b>Work_accident</b>: Any workplace accidents? (Yes/No)</li>
                <li><b>left</b>: Did they leave the company? (Yes/No - Our target!)</li>
                <li><b>promotion_last_5years</b>: Recent promotion? (Yes/No)</li>
                <li><b>Department</b>: Which team?</li>
                <li><b>salary</b>: Compensation level (low, medium, high)</li>
            </ul>
            <button class="collapsible" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="data-prep-content">Data Preparation Insights</button>
            <div class="content" id="data-prep-content">
                <p>Before analysis, we cleaned the data and prepared it for modeling. This involved handling any inconsistencies and converting categorical features like 'Department' and 'salary' into a numerical format (<u>one-hot encoding</u>) that our algorithms can understand.</p>
            </div>

            <h4>Visualizing the Story: Uncovering Patterns</h4>
            <p>Visualizations are crucial for bringing data to life. Let's explore the key patterns revealed in the Salifort Motors dataset:</p>

            <div class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_1.png" alt="Boxplot of Tenure" loading="lazy">
                <div class="caption">Chart 1: Employee Tenure Distribution</div>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Shows the typical length of service for employees.</span>
            </div>
            <p>Chart 1 (Tenure Boxplot) shows that the <span class="highlight">median tenure at Salifort is 3 years</span>. Half of the employees stay between 2 and 4 years (the interquartile range). While there are outliers indicating longer service (up to 10 years), the concentration around 3 years suggests this is a critical point for retention efforts.</p>

            <div class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_2.png" alt="Correlation Heatmap" loading="lazy">
                <div class="caption">Chart 2: Correlation Heatmap</div>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Reveals linear relationships between different factors.</span>
            </div>
            <p>Chart 2 (Correlation Heatmap) provides a high-level view of relationships. The most striking finding is the <span class="highlight">negative correlation (-0.35) between satisfaction level and leaving</span>, strongly suggesting that unhappy employees are more likely to depart. We also see positive correlations between project count, evaluation scores, and monthly hours, hinting that higher performers might be taking on more work.</p>

            <div class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_3.png" alt="Employees Leaving by Department" loading="lazy">
                <div class="caption">Chart 3: Turnover by Department</div>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Identifies departments with higher attrition rates.</span>
            </div>
            <p>Chart 3 breaks down attrition by department. The <span class="highlight">Sales, Technical, and Support departments exhibit the highest absolute numbers of departures</span> (orange bars). While Sales also has the largest number of employees overall, the proportional turnover in these areas warrants further investigation into department-specific challenges.</p>

            <div class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_4.png" alt="Employees Leaving by Salary Level" loading="lazy">
                <div class="caption">Chart 4: Turnover by Salary Level</div>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Shows the impact of compensation on retention.</span>
            </div>
            <p>Chart 4 clearly illustrates the link between salary and retention. Employees in the <span class="highlight">low salary bracket have a disproportionately high attrition rate</span> compared to their medium and high-salaried colleagues. This strongly suggests that compensation is a significant factor in employee decisions to leave Salifort Motors.</p>

            <div class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_12.png" alt="Distribution of Salary Levels" loading="lazy">
                <div class="caption">Chart 5: Overall Salary Distribution</div>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Shows the proportion of employees in each salary band.</span>
            </div>
            <p>Chart 5 complements the previous view by showing the overall salary structure. A large portion of the workforce falls into the <span class="highlight">low and medium salary categories</span>, with relatively few employees in the high bracket. This distribution likely contributes to the turnover patterns observed, especially among lower-paid staff.</p>

            <div class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_5.png" alt="Distribution of Satisfaction Levels" loading="lazy">
                <div class="caption">Chart 6: Satisfaction Level Distribution</div>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Visualizes the spread of employee satisfaction scores.</span>
            </div>
            <p>Chart 6 reveals a complex picture of employee satisfaction. The distribution is <span class="highlight">bimodal, with peaks at low satisfaction (around 0.1) and high satisfaction (0.7-0.9)</span>. This polarization suggests distinct groups within the workforce: one potentially disgruntled and at risk of leaving, and another largely content group.</p>

            <div class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_6.png" alt="Distribution of Last Evaluation Scores" loading="lazy">
                <div class="caption">Chart 7: Performance Evaluation Score Distribution</div>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Shows how performance review scores are distributed.</span>
            </div>
            <p>Chart 7 shows the distribution of performance evaluation scores. There are noticeable peaks, particularly around <span class="highlight">0.5-0.6 and above 0.8</span>. This pattern might indicate standardized rating practices or potentially distinct performance groups within the company, which could correlate with workload or satisfaction.</p>

            <div class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_7.png" alt="Number of Projects Undertaken by Employees" loading="lazy">
                <div class="caption">Chart 8: Project Load Distribution</div>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Illustrates the typical number of projects per employee.</span>
            </div>
            <p>Chart 8 indicates that most employees handle <span class="highlight">3 or 4 projects</span> concurrently. However, there are also groups working on only 2 projects, and smaller groups juggling 5, 6, or even 7. Understanding how workload relates to satisfaction and turnover is crucial, as both under-utilization and overload could be problematic.</p>

            <div class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_8.png" alt="Distribution of Average Monthly Hours" loading="lazy">
                <div class="caption">Chart 9: Average Monthly Hours Distribution</div>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Displays the spread of employee working hours.</span>
            </div>
            <p>Chart 9 highlights different work intensity patterns. We see clusters around <span class="highlight">150 hours/month and a larger group working 220-270 hours/month</span>. These distinct groups might represent different roles, departments, or potentially signify issues with work-life balance and burnout risk for those working excessive hours.</p>

            <div class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_9.png" alt="Number of Years Employees Have Spent with the Company" loading="lazy">
                <div class="caption">Chart 10: Employee Tenure Distribution (Bar Chart)</div>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Shows turnover likelihood based on years at the company.</span>
            </div>
            <p>Chart 10 (similar to Chart 1 but as a bar chart) reinforces that the <span class="highlight">highest concentration of employees is at the 3-year tenure mark</span>, followed closely by 2 and 4 years. The sharp drop-off after 5 years suggests challenges in retaining employees long-term, aligning with the insights from the boxplot.</p>

            <div class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_10.png" alt="Promotions in the Last 5 Years vs. Leaving" loading="lazy">
                <div class="caption">Chart 11: Promotion Impact on Turnover</div>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Illustrates the strong link between promotions and retention.</span>
            </div>
            <p>Chart 11 delivers a clear message: <span class="highlight">promotions strongly correlate with retention</span>. While promotions were rare overall (only ~2.6% received one in 5 years), employees who were promoted almost never left. Conversely, a significant portion of those not promoted eventually departed, highlighting the importance of career growth.</p>

            <div class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_11.png" alt="Work Accidents vs. Leaving" loading="lazy">

                <span class="tooltiptext">Examines the surprising relationship between accidents and leaving.</span>
            </div>
            <p>Chart 12 presents a counter-intuitive finding. Employees who experienced a work accident (<span class="highlight">Work_accident = 1</span>) were actually <span class="highlight">less likely to leave</span> the company compared to those who did not have an accident. While accidents are undesirable, this suggests they don't directly drive attrition; perhaps other support mechanisms or factors are at play for this group.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Phase 2: Building Predictive Models</h2>
            <p>Exploratory analysis gave us valuable clues, but predictive modeling helps quantify the impact of different factors and identify the strongest drivers of turnover. We employed the PACE framework to guide this phase.</p>
            <h3>Model Performance: Which Predicts Best?</h3>
            <p>We trained and evaluated three distinct models on unseen test data to predict which employees would leave:</p>
            <h4>Logistic Regression</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Accuracy: <span class="highlight">~78%</span></li>
                <li>Precision: <span class="highlight">~73%</span></li>
                <li>Recall: <span class="highlight">~69%</span></li>
                <li>F1-Score: <span class="highlight">~71%</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>Interpretation: Decent baseline, but struggles to identify a large portion of leavers (lower recall).</i></p>
            <h4>Random Forest</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Accuracy: <span class="highlight">97.83%</span></li>
                <li>Precision: <span class="highlight">98%</span></li>
                <li>Recall: <span class="highlight">89%</span></li>
                <li>F1-Score: <span class="highlight">93%</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>Interpretation: Excellent performance, strong balance between precision and recall.</i></p>
            <h4>XGBoost</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Accuracy: <span class="highlight">97.96%</span></li>
                <li>Precision: <span class="highlight">98%</span></li>
                <li>Recall: <span class="highlight">90%</span></li>
                <li>F1-Score: <span class="highlight">94%</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>Interpretation: Slightly edges out Random Forest, demonstrating exceptional predictive power.</i></p>

            <div class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_15.png" alt="ROC Curve" loading="lazy">
                <div class="caption">Chart 13: Model Predictive Power (ROC Curve)</div>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Visualizes how well models distinguish between leavers and stayers. Higher AUC is better.</span>
            </div>
            <p>Chart 13 (ROC Curve) visually confirms the superior performance of the ensemble methods. Both Random Forest and XGBoost achieve an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of <span class="highlight">0.98</span>, indicating excellent ability to differentiate between employees who will stay and those who will leave, far surpassing a random guess (diagonal line).</p>

            <h3>Feature Importance: What Matters Most?</h3>
            <button class="collapsible" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="feature-importance-content">Feature Importance Analysis Details</button>
            <div class="content" id="feature-importance-content">
                <p>Understanding which factors most influence the models' predictions is key to developing targeted retention strategies. We examined the feature importance scores from our top-performing models:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Satisfaction Level:</b> Consistently ranked as highly important, confirming the EDA findings.</li>
                    <li><b>Time Spent at Company (Tenure):</b> Particularly influential, likely capturing the increased risk around the 3-5 year mark.</li>
                    <li><b>Number of Projects:</b> A significant factor, suggesting workload balance is critical.</li>
                    <li><b>Average Monthly Hours:</b> Work intensity clearly plays a role in turnover decisions.</li>
                    <li><b>Last Evaluation Score:</b> Employee perception of performance and feedback matters.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><i>Note: While both models highlight similar features, their exact ranking can differ slightly, offering complementary perspectives.</i></p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_13.png" alt="Top 10 Important Features - Random Forest" loading="lazy">
                <div class="caption">Chart 14: Key Turnover Drivers (Random Forest)</div>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Shows the top factors predicting turnover according to the Random Forest model.</span>
            </div>
            <p>Chart 14 shows the Random Forest model prioritizes <span class="highlight">satisfaction level</span> as the most critical predictor, followed by tenure, project count, evaluation score, and monthly hours. This strongly suggests focusing on improving employee happiness.</p>

            <div class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_14.png" alt="Top 10 Important Features - XGBoost" loading="lazy">

                <span class="tooltiptext">Shows the top factors predicting turnover according to the XGBoost model.</span>
            </div>
            <p>Chart 15 presents the XGBoost perspective. Interestingly, it ranks <span class="highlight">number of projects</span> slightly higher than satisfaction, though both remain top factors along with tenure, monthly hours, and evaluation score. This highlights the critical interplay between workload, satisfaction, and retention.</p>

            <h3>Choosing the Champion Model</h3>
            <p>While Logistic Regression provided a baseline, the ensemble methods (Random Forest and XGBoost) offered vastly superior predictive power. Given its slight edge in performance metrics (Accuracy, Recall, F1-Score) and its robust handling of complex interactions, we selected <span class="highlight">XGBoost</span> as our champion model for generating actionable insights and identifying employees at high risk of leaving Salifort Motors.</p>

            <h2>Phase 3: Actionable Insights & Recommendations</h2>
            <p>Our comprehensive analysis, blending EDA with the predictive power of the XGBoost model, pinpoints key areas for Salifort Motors to focus on to improve employee retention:</p>
            <p><strong>Key Drivers of Turnover Confirmed:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Low <b>Satisfaction Levels:</b> The most consistent and powerful predictor.</li>
                <li>Critical <b>Tenure Window (3-5 Years):</b> A period of heightened departure risk.</li>
                <li>Imbalanced <b>Workload:</b> Both too many (burnout) and potentially too few (disengagement) projects matter.</li>
                <li>High <b>Monthly Working Hours:</b> Strong indicator of potential burnout.</li>
                <li>Lower <b>Performance Evaluations:</b> May correlate with dissatisfaction or lack of growth.</li>
                <li>Lack of Recent <b>Promotions:</b> Career progression is vital for long-term retention.</li>
                <li>Low <b>Salary:</b> Particularly impactful for attrition in lower compensation bands.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><u>Strategic Recommendations:</u></p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Boost Satisfaction:</b> Actively monitor satisfaction (e.g., pulse surveys). Address concerns promptly, focusing on factors identified in EDA (salary, workload, recognition).</li>
                <li><b>Manage Workload & Engagement:</b> Ensure project distribution is fair. Address both potential burnout (high hours/projects) and disengagement (low hours/projects).</li>
                <li><b>Focus on Mid-Tenure Employees:</b> Develop clear career progression paths and growth opportunities for employees in the 3-5 year tenure range. Offer targeted development or mentorship.</li>
                <li><b>Enhance Performance Management:</b> Ensure evaluation processes are fair and constructive. Link performance to development opportunities.</li>
                <li><b>Recognize and Promote:</b> Increase visibility of promotion paths and recognize contributions regularly, not just through formal promotions. Review compensation competitiveness, especially for lower salary bands.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><u>Next Steps for Continuous Improvement:</u></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Conduct qualitative analysis (e.g., exit interviews, focus groups) to understand the 'why' behind dissatisfaction and mid-tenure departures.</li>
                <li>Implement targeted retention pilot programs for high-risk groups identified by the model (e.g., low satisfaction, high workload employees).</li>
                <li>Regularly retrain and validate the predictive model with new data to adapt to changing workforce dynamics.</li>
            </ul>
