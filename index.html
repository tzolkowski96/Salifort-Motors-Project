            <h2>The Story: Why Employee Happiness Matters</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm <b>Tobin Zolkowski</b>. Welcome! This project explores a challenge many companies face: keeping talented employees happy and engaged. At Salifort Motors, we noticed more people were leaving than we'd like. Losing good people isn't just about hiring costs; it affects team spirit and slows down progress.</p>
            <p>So, we put on our detective hats! Using data about our employees, we looked for patterns to understand <i>why</i> people stay and <i>why</i> they might leave. Think of it as using clues hidden in numbers to build a better, more supportive workplace.</p>
            <p>Our goal? To use these insights to help Salifort Motors become an even better place to work, reducing turnover and boosting overall success.</p>

            <h2>Finding Clues: Listening to the Data</h2>
            <p>We started by looking at information from <span class="highlight">15,000 employees</span>, focusing on 10 key areas like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Happiness Level</b>: How satisfied were they?</li>
                <li><b>Performance Score</b>: How did they do in reviews?</li>
                <li><b>Project Load</b>: How many projects were they working on?</li>
                <li><b>Work Hours</b>: How many hours did they typically work?</li>
                <li><b>Time with Company</b>: How many years had they been at Salifort?</li>
                <li><b>Workplace Safety</b>: Any accidents reported?</li>
                <li><b>Left Company?</b>: Did they stay or leave? (This is what we wanted to understand!)</li>
                <li><b>Recent Promotion?</b>: Were they promoted recently?</li>
                <li><b>Team</b>: Which department did they belong to?</li>
                <li><b>Pay Level</b>: Were they paid low, medium, or high compared to others?</li>
            </ul>
            <button class="collapsible" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="data-prep-content">Getting the Data Ready (A Quick Peek Behind the Scenes)</button>
            <div class="content" id="data-prep-content">
                <p>Before digging for clues, we tidied up the data. This meant making sure everything was consistent and translating things like 'Department' and 'Pay Level' into a format our analysis tools could easily understand.</p>
            </div>

            <h4>Visual Clues: What the Charts Told Us</h4>
            <p>Pictures often tell a story better than just numbers. Here are some key discoveries:</p>

            <div class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_1.png" alt="Boxplot of Tenure" loading="lazy">
                <div class="caption">Chart 1: How Long People Stay</div>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Most employees stay around 3 years.</span>
            </div>
            <p>This chart shows that <span class="highlight">3 years is a common length of time</span> for employees at Salifort. Many leave between their 2nd and 4th year. This tells us the 3-year mark is a critical time to focus on keeping people happy.</p>

            <div class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_2.png" alt="Correlation Heatmap" loading="lazy">
                <div class="caption">Chart 2: Connecting the Dots</div>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Shows links between different factors. Unhappiness is strongly linked to leaving.</span>
            </div>
            <p>This "heatmap" shows connections. The most important clue? <span class="highlight">Unhappiness is strongly linked to leaving</span>. We also saw that people working on more projects often had higher performance scores and worked more hours – suggesting our high performers might be carrying a heavy load.</p>

            <div class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_3.png" alt="Employees Leaving by Department" loading="lazy">
                <div class="caption">Chart 3: Leaving by Team</div>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Sales, Technical, and Support teams saw the most departures.</span>
            </div>
            <p>Looking at different teams, we saw the <span class="highlight">Sales, Technical, and Support departments had the highest number of people leaving</span>. While these are large teams, it suggests we might need to look closer at the specific challenges within these groups.</p>

            <div class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_4.png" alt="Employees Leaving by Salary Level" loading="lazy">
                <div class="caption">Chart 4: Does Pay Matter?</div>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Yes! Lower pay is linked to higher chances of leaving.</span>
            </div>
            <p>This chart is clear: <span class="highlight">employees earning lower salaries were much more likely to leave</span> than those earning medium or high salaries. Pay is definitely a big factor.</p>

            <div class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_12.png" alt="Distribution of Salary Levels" loading="lazy">
                <div class="caption">Chart 5: How Pay is Spread Out</div>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Most employees are in the low or medium pay bands.</span>
            </div>
            <p>Adding to the story, this chart shows that <span class="highlight">most Salifort employees are in the low and medium pay groups</span>. This helps explain why pay seems to be a major reason for people leaving.</p>

            <div class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_5.png" alt="Distribution of Satisfaction Levels" loading="lazy">
                <div class="caption">Chart 6: Employee Happiness Levels</div>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Shows two main groups: very unhappy and quite happy.</span>
            </div>
            <p>Employee happiness isn't straightforward. We saw <span class="highlight">two main groups: one group very unhappy, and another group quite satisfied</span>. This split suggests we need different approaches for different employees.</p>

            <div class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_6.png" alt="Distribution of Last Evaluation Scores" loading="lazy">
                <div class="caption">Chart 7: Performance Review Scores</div>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Scores often cluster around average and high marks.</span>
            </div>
            <p>Performance scores also showed patterns, with many employees scoring <span class="highlight">around the middle or towards the higher end</span>. How people feel about their performance reviews could be linked to their happiness and workload.</p>

            <div class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_7.png" alt="Number of Projects Undertaken by Employees" loading="lazy">
                <div class="caption">Chart 8: How Many Projects?</div>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Most people handle 3-4 projects.</span>
            </div>
            <p>Most employees juggle <span class="highlight">3 or 4 projects at once</span>. Some have fewer, some have many more (up to 7!). Finding the right balance is key – too few projects might lead to boredom, while too many can cause burnout.</p>

            <div class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_8.png" alt="Distribution of Average Monthly Hours" loading="lazy">
                <div class="caption">Chart 9: Working Hours</div>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Shows two groups: one working standard hours, another working very long hours.</span>
            </div>
            <p>Working hours varied. We saw one group working typical hours (around <span class="highlight">150/month</span>) and another working significantly more (<span class="highlight">220-270/month</span>). Long hours could be a sign of burnout risk.</p>

            <div class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_9.png" alt="Number of Years Employees Have Spent with the Company" loading="lazy">
                <div class="caption">Chart 10: Years at Salifort (Another Look)</div>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Confirms the 3-year mark is key, with fewer staying past 5 years.</span>
            </div>
            <p>This chart confirms what we saw earlier: the <span class="highlight">highest number of employees have been here for 3 years</span>. Fewer employees stay beyond the 5-year mark, highlighting a challenge in long-term retention.</p>

            <div class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_10.png" alt="Promotions in the Last 5 Years vs. Leaving" loading="lazy">
                <div class="caption">Chart 11: Promotions Keep People!</div>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Employees who get promoted rarely leave.</span>
            </div>
            <p>This is a powerful clue: <span class="highlight">getting promoted makes a huge difference</span>. Very few employees who received a promotion in the last 5 years left the company. This shows how important growth opportunities are.</p>

            <div class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_11.png" alt="Work Accidents vs. Leaving" loading="lazy">
                <div class="caption">Chart 12: Workplace Accidents & Staying</div>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Surprisingly, those with accidents were less likely to leave.</span>
            </div>
            <p>Here's a surprise: employees who had a work accident were actually <span class="highlight">less likely to leave</span>. While safety is always crucial, this suggests accidents themselves aren't driving people away – perhaps other support systems kick in.</p>

            <h2>Making Predictions: Building a Crystal Ball</h2>
            <p>Finding clues was the first step. Next, we wanted to build a tool – like a data crystal ball – that could help predict which employees might be unhappy or thinking about leaving <i>before</i> it happens. We tested a few different approaches.</p>
            <h3>Testing Our Crystal Balls</h3>
            <p>We used three methods to see which could predict employee departures most accurately:</p>
            <h4>Method 1: Simple Logic (Logistic Regression)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Accuracy (Overall Correctness): <span class="highlight">~78%</span></li>
                <li>Precision (Correctly ID'ing Leavers): <span class="highlight">~73%</span></li>
                <li>Recall (Finding Most Leavers): <span class="highlight">~69%</span></li>
                <li>F1-Score (Balanced Score): <span class="highlight">~71%</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>Result: A decent start, but it missed identifying many of the employees who actually left.</i></p>
            <h4>Method 2: Teamwork Trees (Random Forest)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Accuracy: <span class="highlight">97.83%</span></li>
                <li>Precision: <span class="highlight">98%</span></li>
                <li>Recall: <span class="highlight">89%</span></li>
                <li>F1-Score: <span class="highlight">93%</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>Result: Much better! Very accurate and good at finding most of the employees who left.</i></p>
            <h4>Method 3: Smart Boosting (XGBoost)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Accuracy: <span class="highlight">97.96%</span></li>
                <li>Precision: <span class="highlight">98%</span></li>
                <li>Recall: <span class="highlight">90%</span></li>
                <li>F1-Score: <span class="highlight">94%</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>Result: The best performer! Extremely accurate and slightly better at identifying employees likely to leave.</i></p>

            <div class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_15.png" alt="ROC Curve" loading="lazy">
                <div class="caption">Chart 13: How Well the Crystal Balls Work</div>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Higher lines mean better predictions. Methods 2 & 3 are excellent.</span>
            </div>
            <p>This chart confirms that Methods 2 and 3 (the green and orange lines) were far superior at distinguishing between employees who stayed and those who left compared to Method 1 (blue line) or just guessing (dotted line). Both achieved a score (AUC) of <span class="highlight">0.98</span>, which is excellent.</p>

            <h3>What Clues Did the Best Crystal Ball Use?</h3>
            <button class="collapsible" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="feature-importance-content">Which Clues Mattered Most?</button>
            <div class="content" id="feature-importance-content">
                <p>Knowing *which* clues our best prediction methods relied on helps us focus our efforts. Here's what mattered most:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Happiness Level:</b> Consistently a top factor. Unhappy employees are a major risk.</li>
                    <li><b>Time with Company:</b> The 3-5 year mark is a critical period.</li>
                    <li><b>Number of Projects:</b> Workload balance is crucial.</li>
                    <li><b>Average Work Hours:</b> Long hours signal potential burnout.</li>
                    <li><b>Performance Score:</b> How employees feel about their performance matters.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><i>Note: Both top methods pointed to similar clues, giving us confidence in these findings.</i></p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_13.png" alt="Top 10 Important Features - Random Forest" loading="lazy">
                <div class="caption">Chart 14: Top Clues (Method 2: Teamwork Trees)</div>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Happiness level was the #1 clue for this method.</span>
            </div>
            <p>Chart 14 shows that Method 2 relied most heavily on <span class="highlight">happiness level</span>, followed by time with the company, project count, performance score, and work hours.</p>

            <div class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_14.png" alt="Top 10 Important Features - XGBoost" loading="lazy">
                <div class="caption">Chart 15: Top Clues (Method 3: Smart Boosting)</div>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Project count and happiness were top clues here.</span>
            </div>
            <p>Chart 15 shows our best method (Method 3) also valued these clues highly, ranking <span class="highlight">project count</span> and <span class="highlight">happiness level</span> as extremely important, along with time at company, work hours, and performance score.</p>

            <h3>Our Champion Predictor</h3>
            <p>While the simple logic method was okay, the more advanced "Teamwork Trees" and "Smart Boosting" methods were far better. Because "Smart Boosting" (<span class="highlight">XGBoost</span>) was slightly more accurate and effective, we chose it as our champion crystal ball to help Salifort identify employees who might need support.</p>

            <h2>Solutions: Building a Happier Workplace</h2>
            <p>By combining the clues from our data exploration with the insights from our predictive crystal ball (XGBoost), we can suggest practical steps for Salifort Motors:</p>
            <p><strong>What We Learned (The Key Takeaways):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Happiness is King:</b> Low satisfaction is the biggest warning sign.</li>
                <li><b>The 3-5 Year Itch:</b> This period is crucial for retention.</li>
                <li><b>Workload Balance Matters:</b> Too many projects (burnout) or too few (boredom) can be problems.</li>
                <li><b>Long Hours = Risk:</b> High monthly hours often lead to departures.</li>
                <li><b>Performance & Growth:</b> Feeling undervalued or stuck impacts decisions.</li>
                <li><b>Promotions Retain:</b> Lack of advancement opportunities is a major factor.</li>
                <li><b>Fair Pay is Essential:</b> Especially for those in lower pay bands.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><u>Recommendations for Salifort Motors:</u></p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Tune In to Happiness:</b> Regularly check in on employee satisfaction (e.g., quick surveys). Address concerns about pay, workload, and recognition quickly.</li>
                <li><b>Balance the Load:</b> Ensure projects are distributed fairly. Watch out for signs of burnout (too many hours/projects) and disengagement (too few).</li>
                <li><b>Invest in Mid-Career Growth:</b> Create clear paths for advancement, especially for employees nearing the 3-5 year mark. Offer training or mentoring.</li>
                <li><b>Make Reviews Meaningful:</b> Ensure performance reviews are fair, constructive, and linked to growth opportunities.</li>
                <li><b>Recognize & Reward:</b> Celebrate achievements regularly. Make promotion paths clear and review pay scales to ensure competitiveness, particularly for lower-paid roles.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><u>Next Steps: Keep Improving!</u></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Talk to employees (especially those leaving) to understand the 'why' behind the data.</li>
                <li>Try out targeted support programs for employees flagged by our crystal ball as high-risk.</li>
                <li>Keep the crystal ball updated with new data so it stays accurate over time.</li>
