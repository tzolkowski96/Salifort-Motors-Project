            <h2 id="story-heading">The Story: Why Employee Happiness Matters More Than Ever</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm <b>Tobin Zolkowski</b>. Welcome! Ever wonder what makes a workplace truly great? It's the people, right? At Salifort Motors, we value our team immensely. But recently, we noticed something concerning: more talented folks were heading for the exit than we were comfortable with. Losing great employees isn't just a line item on a budget for hiring replacements; it's a ripple effect. It impacts team morale, slows down innovation, and means losing valuable experience.</p>
            <p>So, we decided to become data detectives! We gathered information (completely anonymous, of course) about our employees' experiences – things like their satisfaction levels, workload, time with the company, and growth opportunities. Our mission? To uncover the hidden patterns and understand the real story behind <i>why</i> some people thrive and stay long-term, while others decide it's time to move on.</p>
            <p>Think of it like listening carefully to thousands of voices at once, finding the common threads in their stories. Our ultimate goal is to use these insights not just to reduce turnover, but to proactively build a more supportive, engaging, and ultimately happier workplace for everyone at Salifort Motors. Because when our people succeed, the whole company succeeds.</p>

            <h2 id="clues-heading">Finding Clues: Listening to the Data's Whispers</h2>
            <p>Our investigation started by carefully examining the experiences of <span class="highlight">15,000 employees</span>. We looked at ten key pieces of the puzzle, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Happiness Level (Satisfaction)</b>: On a scale, how content were people feeling? (A crucial clue!)</li>
                <li><b>Performance Score (Last Evaluation)</b>: How did their recent performance review go?</li>
                <li><b>Project Load (Number of Projects)</b>: Were they juggling a few key tasks or swimming in projects?</li>
                <li><b>Work Hours (Average Monthly Hours)</b>: Were they working standard hours, or consistently burning the midnight oil?</li>
                <li><b>Time with Company (Tenure)</b>: How many years had they dedicated to Salifort?</li>
                <li><b>Workplace Safety (Work Accident)</b>: Had they unfortunately experienced an accident on the job?</li>
                <li><b>Left Company?</b>: The big question – did they stay or did they go?</li>
                <li><b>Recent Promotion? (Last 5 Years)</b>: Had they moved up the ladder recently?</li>
                <li><b>Team (Department)</b>: Which part of the Salifort family did they belong to?</li>
                <li><b>Pay Level (Salary)</b>: How did their compensation compare – low, medium, or high?</li>
            </ul>
            <button class="collapsible" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="data-prep-content">Getting the Data Ready (A Quick Peek Behind the Scenes)</button>
            <div class="content" id="data-prep-content" hidden>
                <p>Before we could find the real insights, we had to do some digital housekeeping. This involved cleaning up the data, making sure everything was consistent, and translating categories like 'Department' and 'Salary' into a language our analysis tools could understand. It's like organizing your detective notes before you start connecting the dots!</p>
            </div>

            <h4>Visual Clues: What the Charts Revealed</h4>
            <p>Numbers can be dry, but charts bring the story to life! We created visualizations to spot trends and patterns. Here's what jumped out:</p>

            <figure class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_1.png" alt="Boxplot showing employee tenure distribution. Median tenure is 3 years, with many leaving between years 2 and 4." loading="lazy">
                <figcaption class="caption">Chart 1: The Salifort Journey - How Long Do People Stay?</figcaption>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Most employees stay around 3 years. The 2-4 year mark is key.</span>
            </figure>
            <p>This chart tells us about the typical employee journey length. The sweet spot seems to be <span class="highlight">around 3 years</span>. Notice how many people move on between their second and fourth year? This isn't necessarily bad, but it signals that this timeframe is a critical window for ensuring employees feel valued and see a future here.</p>

            <figure class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_2.png" alt="Correlation heatmap showing relationships between employee factors. Strong negative correlation between satisfaction level and leaving." loading="lazy">
                <figcaption class="caption">Chart 2: Connecting the Dots - What Factors are Linked?</figcaption>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Shows links between different factors. Unhappiness is strongly linked to leaving.</span>
            </figure>
            <p>Think of this "heatmap" like a relationship map. The darker the color, the stronger the connection. The most striking connection? <span class="highlight">Unhappiness (low satisfaction) has a strong link to employees leaving</span>. No huge surprise, but the data confirms it loud and clear. We also saw interesting links: people handling more projects often scored higher in reviews and worked longer hours. This hints that our top performers might be feeling the strain.</p>

            <figure class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_3.png" alt="Bar chart showing number of employees who left by department. Sales, Technical, and Support departments have the highest counts." loading="lazy">
                <figcaption class="caption">Chart 3: Where Are People Leaving From? (Team View)</figcaption>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Sales, Technical, and Support teams saw the most departures.</span>
            </figure>
            <p>When we looked at departures by department, the <span class="highlight">Sales, Technical, and Support teams stood out</span>. Now, these are large teams, so more departures are expected. However, it does suggest we should perhaps look closer at the unique pressures or opportunities within these specific groups.</p>

            <figure class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_4.png" alt="Bar chart comparing employees who left vs. stayed across salary levels. Significantly more low-salary employees left compared to medium or high." loading="lazy">
                <figcaption class="caption">Chart 4: Does Pay Make a Difference?</figcaption>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Yes! Lower pay is linked to higher chances of leaving.</span>
            </figure>
            <p>Money talks, and the data listens. This chart paints a clear picture: <span class="highlight">employees in the lower salary bracket were significantly more likely to leave</span> compared to their colleagues earning medium or high salaries. Compensation is undeniably a major factor in retention.</p>

            <figure class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_12.png" alt="Bar chart showing the distribution of employees across low, medium, and high salary levels. Most employees are in the low and medium bands." loading="lazy">
                <figcaption class="caption">Chart 5: The Salary Landscape at Salifort</figcaption>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Most employees are in the low or medium pay bands.</span>
            </figure>
            <p>This chart adds important context to the previous one. It shows that <span class="highlight">a large portion of Salifort's workforce falls into the low and medium salary categories</span>. This distribution helps explain *why* pay appears to be such a significant driver of turnover – it affects a large number of our people.</p>

            <figure class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_5.png" alt="Histogram of employee satisfaction levels. Shows a bimodal distribution with peaks at low satisfaction (around 0.1 and 0.4) and high satisfaction (around 0.7-1.0)." loading="lazy">
                <figcaption class="caption">Chart 6: The Mood Map - How Happy Are Our Teams?</figcaption>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Shows two main groups: very unhappy and quite happy. Few in the middle.</span>
            </figure>
            <p>Employee happiness isn't a simple bell curve here. We see <span class="highlight">two distinct groups: a significant cluster of very unhappy employees, and another large group who are quite satisfied</span>. There aren't many people feeling just "okay." This polarization suggests we need tailored strategies – what works for the happy group might not resonate with the unhappy one.</p>

            <figure class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_6.png" alt="Histogram of last evaluation scores. Shows a bimodal distribution with peaks around 0.5-0.6 and near 1.0." loading="lazy">
                <figcaption class="caption">Chart 7: Performance Snapshot - How Are Reviews Looking?</figcaption>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Scores often cluster around average and high marks.</span>
            </figure>
            <p>Performance reviews also showed interesting clusters. Many employees received scores <span class="highlight">around the middle range, while another group scored very highly</span>. How people perceive their performance and the feedback process could be intertwined with their overall satisfaction and workload.</p>

            <figure class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_7.png" alt="Histogram showing the number of projects employees work on. Most common numbers are 3 and 4 projects." loading="lazy">
                <figcaption class="caption">Chart 8: Juggling Act - How Many Projects Per Person?</figcaption>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Most people handle 3-4 projects. Some handle many more (up to 7!).</span>
            </figure>
            <p>What's a typical workload like? Most employees are juggling <span class="highlight">3 or 4 projects simultaneously</span>. However, some are focused on fewer, while others are tackling a demanding 6 or 7! Finding the sweet spot is crucial. Too few projects might lead to boredom, but too many is a recipe for burnout.</p>

            <figure class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_8.png" alt="Histogram of average monthly hours worked. Shows two main groups: one around 150 hours/month, another around 220-270 hours/month." loading="lazy">
                <figcaption class="caption">Chart 9: Punching the Clock - What Do Work Hours Look Like?</figcaption>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Shows two groups: one working standard hours, another working very long hours.</span>
            </figure>
            <p>Work hours tell a tale of two cities. We see one group working fairly standard hours (around <span class="highlight">150 per month</span>), but another group consistently putting in significantly more time (<span class="highlight">220-270 hours per month</span>). These long hours could be a major red flag for potential burnout and dissatisfaction.</p>

            <figure class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_9.png" alt="Histogram showing employee tenure in years. The highest bar is at 3 years, with counts decreasing significantly after 5 years." loading="lazy">
                <figcaption class="caption">Chart 10: Years of Service - The 3-Year Milestone</figcaption>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Confirms the 3-year mark is key, with fewer staying past 5 years.</span>
            </figure>
            <p>This chart reinforces our earlier finding about the employee journey. The <span class="highlight">most common tenure is 3 years</span>. After the 5-year mark, the numbers drop off noticeably. This highlights a potential challenge in retaining experienced employees long-term.</p>

            <figure class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_10.png" alt="Stacked bar chart comparing promotion status (yes/no in last 5 years) for employees who left vs. stayed. Very few promoted employees left." loading="lazy">

                <span class="tooltiptext">Employees who get promoted rarely leave. Growth matters!</span>
            </figure>
            <p>This clue is incredibly powerful. Look closely: <span class="highlight">employees who received a promotion within the last 5 years almost never left the company</span>. It's a tiny orange sliver! This clearly demonstrates how vital growth opportunities and feeling valued through advancement are for retention.</p>

            <figure class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_11.png" alt="Stacked bar chart comparing work accident status (yes/no) for employees who left vs. stayed. A higher proportion of those who stayed had an accident." loading="lazy">

                <span class="tooltiptext">Surprisingly, those with accidents were less likely to leave.</span>
            </figure>
            <p>Here's a curveball from the data: employees who experienced a work accident were actually <span class="highlight">less likely to leave</span>. Safety is paramount, always. But this unexpected finding suggests that perhaps the support systems that kick in after an incident, or other factors, play a role in these employees choosing to stay.</p>

            <h2 id="predictions-heading">Making Predictions: Building an Early Warning System</h2>
            <p>Spotting clues in past data is insightful, but what if we could anticipate the future? The next step was to build a predictive tool – think of it as an early warning system – that could help us identify employees who might be feeling unhappy or considering leaving, *before* they make the decision. This allows us to offer support proactively.</p>
            <h3>Testing Our Crystal Balls: Which Predictor Works Best?</h3>
            <p>We didn't just build one predictor; we tested three different methods, each with its own way of learning from the data, to see which one could most accurately flag potential departures:</p>
            <h4>Method 1: Simple Logic (Logistic Regression) - The Straightforward Approach</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Accuracy (Overall Correctness): <span class="highlight">~78%</span> - Okay, but not great.</li>
                <li>Precision (Correctly ID'ing Leavers): <span class="highlight">~73%</span> - When it said someone might leave, it was right about 3 out of 4 times.</li>
                <li>Recall (Finding Most Leavers): <span class="highlight">~69%</span> - Missed identifying nearly a third of those who actually left.</li>
                <li>F1-Score (Balanced Score): <span class="highlight">~71%</span> - A decent balance, but room for improvement.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>Result: A reasonable starting point, but not sensitive enough. It let too many potential leavers slip through the cracks unnoticed.</i></p>
            <h4>Method 2: Teamwork Trees (Random Forest) - The Collaborative Approach</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Accuracy: <span class="highlight">97.83%</span> - Highly accurate overall!</li>
                <li>Precision: <span class="highlight">98%</span> - Very reliable when flagging someone as a potential leaver.</li>
                <li>Recall: <span class="highlight">89%</span> - Successfully identified almost 9 out of 10 employees who left.</li>
                <li>F1-Score: <span class="highlight">93%</span> - Excellent balance between precision and recall.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>Result: A huge improvement! This method, which uses many decision trees working together, was much better at accurately identifying employees at risk.</i></p>
            <h4>Method 3: Smart Boosting (XGBoost) - The Expert Learner Approach</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Accuracy: <span class="highlight">97.96%</span> - The top performer in overall accuracy!</li>
                <li>Precision: <span class="highlight">98%</span> - Just as reliable as Random Forest.</li>
                <li>Recall: <span class="highlight">90%</span> - Slightly better at catching potential leavers (identified 9 out of 10).</li>
                <li>F1-Score: <span class="highlight">94%</span> - The best balance achieved.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>Result: Our champion! This advanced method learned from the data exceptionally well, proving slightly more effective at the crucial task of identifying employees who might need support.</i></p>

            <figure class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_15.png" alt="ROC curves comparing Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models. Random Forest and XGBoost curves are very close to the top-left corner (AUC 0.98), indicating excellent performance, while Logistic Regression is lower." loading="lazy">
                <figcaption class="caption">Chart 13: Grading the Crystal Balls (ROC Curve)</figcaption>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Higher lines mean better predictions. Methods 2 & 3 (Green/Orange) hug the top-left = Excellent!</span>
            </figure>
            <p>This chart visually confirms the scores. The closer a line gets to the top-left corner, the better the predictor. See how the green (Random Forest) and orange (XGBoost) lines soar high? They achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) score of <span class="highlight">0.98</span> (where 1.0 is perfect), vastly outperforming the blue line (Logistic Regression) and the dotted line (pure chance). This gives us great confidence in our advanced methods.</p>

            <h3>What Clues Did the Best Predictors Focus On?</h3>
            <button class="collapsible" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="feature-importance-content">Which Clues Mattered Most to the Predictors?</button>
            <div class="content" id="feature-importance-content" hidden>
                <p>Knowing *which* clues our best prediction methods relied on helps us focus our efforts. Both models highlighted similar key factors, though with slightly different emphasis:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Satisfaction Level:</b> The strongest predictor in the Random Forest model and second in XGBoost. Clearly critical. If someone's unhappy, the models paid attention.</li>
                    <li><b>Tenure (Time with Company):</b> A top-3 factor in both models, emphasizing the importance of the 3-5 year period. How long someone has been here is a key indicator.</li>
                    <li><b>Number of Projects:</b> Ranked #1 by XGBoost and #3 by Random Forest, indicating workload is a major factor. Feeling overloaded (or underutilized) matters.</li>
                    <li><b>Average Monthly Hours:</b> Important for both models, linking long hours to turnover risk. Consistent overtime was a red flag for the predictors.</li>
                    <li><b>Evaluation Score:</b> Also appeared in the top factors, suggesting performance perception and feedback play a role.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><i>Note: The consistency across models gives us confidence that focusing on satisfaction, tenure, workload (projects/hours), and evaluation/growth is key. The predictors learned what our earlier charts suggested!</i></p>
            </div>
            <figure class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_13.png" alt="Bar chart showing top 10 feature importances for the Random Forest model. Satisfaction level, tenure, number of projects, evaluation score, and average monthly hours are the top 5." loading="lazy">
                <figcaption class="caption">Chart 14: Top Clues for Teamwork Trees (Random Forest)</figcaption>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Happiness level was the #1 clue for this method.</span>
            </figure>
            <p>Chart 14 breaks down what the "Teamwork Trees" method valued most. It overwhelmingly pointed to <span class="highlight">satisfaction level</span> as the number one predictor, followed by <span class="highlight">tenure (time with company)</span>, <span class="highlight">number of projects</span>, and <span class="highlight">average monthly hours</span>.</p>

            <figure class="image-container tooltip">
                <img src="images/image_14.png" alt="Bar chart showing top 10 feature importances for the XGBoost model. Number of projects, satisfaction level, tenure, average monthly hours, and evaluation score are the top 5." loading="lazy">
                <figcaption class="caption">Chart 15: Top Clues for the Expert Learner (XGBoost)</figcaption>
                <span class="tooltiptext">Project count, satisfaction, and tenure were top clues here.</span>
            </figure>
            <p>Chart 15 shows the perspective of our champion predictor, "Smart Boosting." Interestingly, it ranked <span class="highlight">number of projects</span> as the most critical factor, followed very closely by <span class="highlight">satisfaction level</span> and <span class="highlight">tenure (time with company)</span>. Workload seemed slightly more significant to this model.</p>

            <h3>Our Champion Predictor: XGBoost Takes the Lead</h3>
            <p>While the simple logic method gave us a basic understanding, the advanced "Teamwork Trees" and "Smart Boosting" methods were in a different league. Because "Smart Boosting" (<span class="highlight">XGBoost</span>) consistently demonstrated slightly better accuracy and, crucially, a better ability to identify employees who might leave (higher recall), we selected it as our go-to early warning system for Salifort Motors.</p>

            <p>Okay, we've listened to the data, found the clues, and even built an early warning system. Now for the most important part: what do we *do* about it? How can Salifort Motors use these insights to build a workplace where people feel valued, supported, and excited to stay?</p>
            <p><strong>What We Learned (The Key Takeaways Summarized):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Happiness is Paramount:</b> Low satisfaction isn't just a feeling; it's the biggest predictor of someone leaving.</li>
                <li><b>The Critical Mid-Career Point:</b> The 3-5 year mark is a make-or-break period for many employees.</li>
                <li><b>Workload Balance is Key:</b> Burnout from too many projects/hours, or boredom from too few, pushes people away.</li>
                <li><b>Long Hours Signal Risk:</b> Consistently high monthly hours are a strong indicator of potential departure.</li>
                <li><b>Performance, Recognition & Growth Matter:</b> Feeling stuck, unappreciated, or unfairly evaluated impacts retention.</li>
                <li><b>Promotions are Powerful Retention Tools:</b> Lack of clear advancement opportunities is a major reason people look elsewhere.</li>
                <li><b>Fair Compensation is Foundational:</b> Especially for those in lower salary bands, feeling underpaid is a strong push factor.</li>

                <li><b>Proactively Monitor & Address Satisfaction:</b> Don't wait for exit interviews. Implement regular, light-touch check-ins (like pulse surveys) focused on satisfaction, workload, and recognition. Crucially, act on the feedback promptly.</li>
                <li><b>Optimize Workload Distribution:</b> Managers should actively monitor project counts and average hours. Aim for a challenging but sustainable balance. Use the predictive model to flag potential overload/underload situations early.</li>
                <li><b>Invest in Mid-Career Development & Retention:</b> Pay special attention to employees approaching the 3-5 year mark. Offer targeted development programs, mentorship opportunities, and clear discussions about career paths within Salifort.</li>
                <li><b>Enhance the Performance Review Experience:</b> Ensure reviews are perceived as fair, constructive, and genuinely linked to growth. Train managers to deliver effective feedback and discuss career aspirations.</li>
                <li><b>Strengthen Recognition & Reward Systems:</b> Celebrate successes publicly and privately. Make promotion criteria transparent and achievable. Conduct regular salary benchmarking to ensure competitiveness, paying close attention to the lower and medium bands.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><u>Looking Ahead: Continuous Improvement</u></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Gather Qualitative Insights:</b> Supplement the data with real conversations. Conduct "stay interviews" with happy employees and empathetic exit interviews to understand the nuances the numbers can't capture.</li>
                <li><b>Pilot Targeted Interventions:</b> Use the predictive model to identify at-risk groups and pilot specific support programs (e.g., workload adjustments, mentoring, training) for them. Measure the impact.</li>
                <li><b>Keep the Model Fresh:</b> Regularly retrain the predictive model with new employee data to ensure it remains accurate and relevant as the company evolves.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By taking these steps, Salifort Motors can move from simply reacting to turnover to proactively building an environment where talented people choose to build their careers.</p>

            <p>This project wasn't just about crunching numbers; it was about translating data into a human story and actionable strategies for Salifort Motors' HR team and leadership. It demonstrates how data analysis, when combined with practical business thinking, can lead to meaningful improvements in the workplace.</p>
            <p>I'm Tobin Zolkowski, the data detective behind this analysis. I'm passionate about using data to uncover insights and solve real-world problems. If you're curious about the technical nitty-gritty (the Python code, model details, etc.), feel free to explore the full analysis on my GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/tzolkowski96/tzolkowski96/tree/main/Employee-Churn-Prediction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Salifort Employee Churn Analysis</a>.</p>
            <p><i>Transparency Note: This analysis was performed as part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Capstone course on Coursera. The dataset, while realistic, was provided by the course for educational purposes.</i></p>
